            <p>Apart from being a job to advance in the creation of web pages, it can also help you open your mind to a new culinary world with these three simple recipes</p>
            <p>As you can see, the 3 recipes that are (lasagna, pizza and pasta bolognese) are recipes that in my personal opinion are very exquisite and delicious.</p>

                <p>I hope you follow everything step by step and do not skip any explained steps; you skip a step and ruin the whole meal. Likewise with the ingredients, they have to be all those that are named in each recipe (with the exception of pasta, you can choose the brand of pasta as you wish) and prepare everything to the given measure.</p>
                
               <p> I hope this guide helps you improve your talent in the kitchen and surprise all your guests.</p>
