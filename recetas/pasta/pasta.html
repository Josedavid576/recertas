    <h1>**How to prepare delicious bolognese pasta**</h1>
    <img src="imagen/Pastablg.jpg" alt="" height="550" width="900">
    <p>Welcome to our kitchen! Today we will embark on the preparation of an authentic Italian classic: pasta bolognese. In just 50 minutes, and with simple ingredients, you can create a delicious and satisfying dish for 4 people.

        We will begin by browning a mixture of beef and pork along with onion, carrot and celery, creating an aromatic base that will give depth to our sauce. These ingredients will cook over low heat, allowing their flavors to merge and intensify. Then, we will add fresh tomatoes, which will provide freshness and balanced acidity to the sauce.
        
        While the bolognese cooks and enriches, we will prepare the pasta so that it is al dente, just as Italian tradition dictates. The combination of the robust sauce and the perfectly cooked pasta will result in a dish full of flavor and texture.
        
        This dish is not only a delight for the palate, but also a fantastic way to gather family or friends around the table. Get ready to enjoy a culinary experience that will capture the essence of Italian cuisine and make every bite a celebration!</p>
