<p>Welcome to our kitchen! Today we're making a delicious ranch-style pizza with jalapeños, a simple and tasty recipe that's ready in just 35 minutes. We'll start by spreading a base of pizza dough that will serve as the perfect canvas for a blend of vibrant flavors.

    First, we'll spread a generous layer of tomato sauce over the dough, adding a touch of freshness and acidity. Next, we'll add canned beans for a smooth texture and rich flavor. Then, we'll sprinkle 150 grams of shredded mozzarella cheese, which will melt into a golden, delicious layer.
    
    To intensify the flavors, we'll add 125 grams of canned jalapeño peppers for a spicy kick. We'll also include 100 grams of spicy chorizo, which will provide a robust flavor and juicy texture. Finally, we'll scatter thin slices of half an onion to add a touch of sweetness and crunch.
    
    Once everything is prepared, we'll bake our pizza until the crust is crispy and the cheese is bubbling. The result will be a flavorful ranch-style pizza that's perfect for sharing on any occasion. Get ready to enjoy a feast of flavors in every bite!
